# rsHook
rudimentary ioHook replacement

**This is a demo, it is not intended for production use.**

# Getting Started:
this has no js deps aside from node itself.
However, it does have rust deps, so make sure you have rust installed.

```sh
# Test
npm run rs:build
npm test # type "quit" to end

# Start
npm run rs:build
npm start

# build
npm run build
npm run build:test
```
